# MCP Tool Kit

A modular server implementation for building high precision vertical AI agents. Intended for use building high precision vertical AI agents, but can deploy to gain access to general tool functionality.

Uses >=50% less code than the Python MCP SDK alone.

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Reduces Cognitive Load on Claude**: Claude doesn't need to reason about the sequence of tool calls
- **Encapsulates Domain Knowledge**: The agent can contain domain-specific logic about how to perform tasks well in a particular vertical
- **Simplifies Error Handling**: The agent can handle errors and retries internally without Claude's involvement
- **Enables Complex Workflows**: Multi-step processes that would be difficult to coordinate through individual tool calls
- **Maintains Conversational Flow**: The user isn't exposed to the complexity of the underlying system

### Example Scenario
Here's a concrete example of Claude invoking a vertical agent:

```
User: "I need a comprehensive analysis of the electric vehicle market for a presentation tomorrow."

Claude: [recognizes this requires multiple tools and domain expertise]

Claude: "I'll help you with that comprehensive EV market analysis. I'll need to gather the latest market data, news, and trends. This will take a moment..."

[Behind the scenes, Claude calls a MarketAnalysisAgent]

Claude -> MarketAnalysisAgent.analyze_market(
    sector="electric vehicles",
    include_news=True,
    include_market_data=True,
    create_presentation=True
)

[The agent orchestrates multiple tool calls using your toolkit]
- news_search for recent EV news
- brave_web_search for market data
- sequential_thinking for analysis
- write_file to save the report
- ppt_create_presentation to generate slides

[Agent returns results to Claude]

Claude: "I've analyzed the electric vehicle market for you. Here are the key findings:
1. Tesla continues to lead with 65% market share in North America
2. BYD has overtaken VW in global sales volume
3. Battery technology breakthroughs are accelerating adoption

I've also created a presentation with detailed charts and data. You can find it saved as 'EV_Market_Analysis.pptx' in your working directory."
```

## Quickstart Guide: Deploy Your First MCP Server with Default Tools
Note: ensure that you have git downloaded (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and Docker downloaded (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and running. You also must ensure the git executable file is added to path (instructions towards end of this README).

## Docker deployment (recommended & most stable)
1) Clone the repository:
```git 
clone https://github.com/getfounded/mcp-tool-kit.git
cd mcp-tool-kit
```
2) You can then use Docker in one of two ways:
Option 1 - Using docker-compose:
```
docker-compose up
```
Option 2 - Direct Docker command:
```
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v ~/documents:/app/documents getfounded/mcp-tool-kit:latest
```

The repository includes a sample Claude desktop configuration file (`claude_desktop_config.json`) that you can use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unified": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "exec",
        "-i",
        "mcp-tool-kit-mcp-server",
        "python",
        "-u",
        "mcp_unified_server.py"
      ],
      "useStdio": true
    }
  }
}
```
### Troubleshooting docker
If you are getting errors running docker, it is likely that the image name is incorrect in the Claude desktop configuration file. A common fix is to use the following json for configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unified": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "exec",
        "-i",
        "mcp-tool-kit-mcp-server-1",
        "python",
        "-u",
        "mcp_unified_server.py"
      ],
      "useStdio": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Install via pip
```bash
# Simple installation
pip install mcptoolkit

# Launch the server with default configuration
mcptoolkit-server
```


Local server basic configuration:

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "MCP Toolkit",
      "url": "http://localhost:8000"
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "allowed_directories": ["~/Documents", "~/Downloads"],
    "default_tools": ["MCP Toolkit"]
  }
}
```

## Configure Claude Desktop to Access Your Server

1. Open Claude Desktop app
2. Go to File > Settings > Developer > Edit config
3. Add the 'claude_desktop_configuration.json' file
4. Save the configuration
5. Restart the MCP server with your new tool integrated
6. Restart and Open Claude Desktop app (for windows users you must use task manager to end task for all Claude instances)


You can import this configuration in the Claude desktop app or use it as a reference to create your own.

You now have immediate access to powerful capabilities including file operations, web search, time tools, and moreâ€”without requiring any API keys or complex setup.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

After cloning the repository, you have two options to configure your environment variables:

### Option 1: Interactive Setup Script

Run the setup script which will guide you through setting up your environment variables:

```bash
python setup_env.py
```

This script will create a `.env` file in the repository with your configuration.

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

Alternatively, you can manually create a `.env` file in the repository root with the following variables:

```
# API Keys for external services
BRAVE_API_KEY=your_brave_api_key
NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
FRED_API_KEY=your_fred_api_key

# Application configuration
STREAMLIT_APPS_DIR=/path/to/streamlit/apps
MCP_FILESYSTEM_DIRS=/path/to/allowed/dir1,/path/to/allowed/dir2
MCP_LOG_LEVEL=info
```
### Sample Claude Prompts

### Adding a New Tool Module

1. Create a new file in the `tools` directory (e.g., `my_tool.py`)
2. Follow the existing module pattern:
   - Create service class
   - Define tool functions
   - Implement registration functions
3. Update `mcp_unified_server.py` to import and register your new module

### Extending an Existing Tool Module

1. Add new methods to the service class
2. Add new tool functions
3. Update the registration function to include your new tools

### Development with Docker

You can use Docker for development to ensure a consistent environment:

```bash
# Build a development image
docker build -t mcp-tool-kit:dev .

# Run with source code mounted for development
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
    -v $(pwd):/app \
    -v ~/documents:/app/documents \
    mcp-tool-kit:dev
```

This mounts your local repository into the container, so changes to the code are reflected immediately (for most files).

## Philosophical Perspective: The Human-AI Cognitive Partnership

The MCP Tool Kit represents a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize the relationship between human intelligence and AI systems. Rather than positioning AI as a mere tool for task automation, this framework establishes a cognitive partnership where human strategic thinking and AI operational capabilities complement each other in profound ways.

The agentic architecture embodies a transformative vision: AI systems that can independently interpret context, make decisions within bounded parameters, and execute complex sequences of actionsâ€”all while maintaining human oversight and strategic direction. This represents not merely a technological advance, but a fundamentally new model for human-machine collaboration.

In this evolving cognitive landscape, the most successful implementations will be those that thoughtfully balance technological potential with human capabilities, creating interfaces that enhance rather than replace human decision-making and creativity.

## Troubleshooting

- **Module not loading**: Check the import path and dependencies
- **API key errors**: Verify your API keys in the `.env` file
- **Permission errors**: Check the allowed directories in `MCP_FILESYSTEM_DIRS`
- **Connection errors**: Ensure the server is running and the port is accessible
- **Agent not detected**: Verify the agent file is in the correct directory and follows the required format
- **Issues with path**: Make sure that git is added to path as per the below instruciton

#To add Git to the PATH on Windows, follow these steps:

1) Locate Git Installation: Determine the path where Git is installed on your system. Common paths include C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe and C:\Program Files\Git\cmd for a standard Git installation, or C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\GitHub\PortableGit_<guid>\bin and C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\GitHub\PortableGit_<guid>\cmd if you installed Git through GitHub for Windows or GitHub Desktop.

2) Edit Environment Variables: Open the "Edit Environment Variables" app either through the Control Panel or by searching for "Edit the system environment variables" in the Start menu. Under the "System variables" section, find the "Path" variable, click "Edit...", and add the path to the Git executable and command files. Ensure there are no spaces around the semicolons separating paths.

3) Save Changes: After adding the Git paths, click "OK" to save your changes. Close and reopen any command prompt windows to apply the new PATH settings.

4) Verify Installation: Open a command prompt and run git --version to verify that Git is accessible from the command line.
